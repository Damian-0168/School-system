### Entity Relationships
- guardians → students (one-to-many via guardian_id)
- families → guardians (one-to-many via family_id)
- classes → students (one-to-many via class_id)
- students → transport (one-to-one active per term via student_id)
- students → payments (one-to-many via student_id)
- students → debt_records (one-to-many via student_id)
- students → student_inventory (one-to-many via student_id)
- students → comments (one-to-many via student_id)
- academic_years → academic_terms (one-to-many via academic_year_id)
- users → payments (one-to-many via recorded_by)
- users → system_logs (one-to-many via user_id)
- payments → payment_allocations (one-to-many via payment_id)

### MySQL-Specific Notes
- Use `BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT` for all primary keys (simpler than UUID)
- Use `JSON` type for details field in system_logs (not JSONB)
- Use `ENUM` for status fields (MySQL native support)
- Use `TINYINT(1)` for boolean fields (is_active, is_sponsored, is_paid)
- Use `TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` for created_at fields
- Add indexes on: admission_no, id_pass_no, student_id, term_id, payment_date
- Foreign keys with `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to prevent accidental deletions

- **Clean**: Professional look with Ant Design components
- **Easy to use**: Minimal clicks for daily tasks (especially payment entry)

### Layout Structure
```
+-----------------------------------------+
|  Sidebar    |  Topbar (User + Stats)    |
|  (Nav)      +---------------------------+
|             |  Main Content Area        |
|  - Dashboard|  (Tables, Forms, Cards)   |
|  - Students |                           |
|  - Payments |                           |
|  - Reports  |                           |
|  - Settings |                           |
+-------------+---------------------------+
```

## Step 6: Validation Rules & Business Logic

### Input Validation
| Field | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Admission No | Unique, auto-generated format: ADM-YYYY-### | "Admission number must be unique" |
| ID Pass No | Unique per term, format: ### or ###/N/YY for re-issues | "ID Pass number already exists" |
| Phone Numbers | Valid Tanzanian format (+255 or 0, 10-15 digits) | "Invalid phone number format" |
| Email | Valid email format (optional field) | "Invalid email format" |
| Amounts | Positive integers, max 10,000,000 TZS | "Amount must be between 0 and 10,000,000 TZS" |
| Payment Date | Cannot be future date, cannot be before term start | "Payment date must be within term dates" |
| Receipt No | Auto-incremented, unique per academic year | "Receipt number generation failed" |
| Student Name | 2-100 characters, alphabetic with spaces | "Name must be 2-100 characters" |
| Gender | Must be M or F | "Gender must be Male or Female" |

### Business Rules
1. **Payment Deadlines**: Each term has a fee deadline; overdue = debt record created automatically
2. **ID Re-issue**: Format `###/1/26` indicates re-issue count and year; tracked in system_logs
3. **Family Discounts**: Applied at family level, not per student; cannot exceed 50% of total fees
4. **Transport**: Billed monthly on the 1st via Node.js cron job; can start/stop independently of tuition; minimum 1 month commitment
5. **Promotions**: Student history must be preserved when changing classes; promotion requires minimum fee clearance (70%)
6. **Receipt Numbers**: Sequential, unique per academic year; cannot be reused even if voided
7. **Currency**: All amounts in Tanzanian Shillings (TZS); integers only (no decimals)
8. **Duplicate Prevention**: No duplicate admission numbers or ID pass numbers; checked before save
9. **Minimum Payment**: Term fee must be at least 50% paid to sit for exams (configurable by Director)
10. **Promotion Eligibility**: Student must have cleared minimum 70% balance to be promoted (configurable)
11. **Withdrawal**: Outstanding balance must be cleared before withdrawal approval; requires Director approval
12. **Voiding Policy**: Payments CANNOT be deleted; must be marked as `voided` with mandatory reason; requires Director approval for amounts > 100,000 TZS
13. **Allocation Priority**: Payments allocated in order: Oldest Debt → Current Tuition → Transport → Stationery
14. **Material Tracking**: "Reams" and "Files" tracked as fulfilled/pending separately from cash balance

Glossary of Terms

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|--------|
| **DENI** | Swahili for "debt" - outstanding fee balance carried forward | "DENI 236,500" = owes 236,500 TZS |
| **REAM** | Stationery item (500 sheets of paper) charged as part of fees | "1 REAM" = one ream of paper |
| **ID PASS** | Student identification card/pass | "ID PAID 411" = ID number 411 issued |

| **Performance** | Load student list < 2 seconds; generate reports < 5 seconds | Tested with 500+ students, 10,000+ payments |
| **Security** | Password hashing, role-based access, session timeout | OWASP Top 10 compliance; session timeout after 30 min |
| **Scalability** | Support 500+ students, 5+ concurrent users | No degradation with 10 concurrent users |
